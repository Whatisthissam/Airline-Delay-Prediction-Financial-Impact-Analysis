# ✈️ Airline Delay Prediction & Financial Impact Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview 

Flight delays significantly affect airline profitability and customer satisfaction.
This project analyzes airline delay patterns, predicts arrival delays using Machine Learning, and estimates financial loss impact.

## 🎯 Objectives

• Analyze delay patterns using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

• Segment flights into risk clusters using K-Means Clustering

• Predict arrival delays using Linear Regression

• Estimate financial loss caused by delays

• Deploy an interactive prediction dashboard using Streamlit

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains flight-level operational data including:

• Airline Carrier

• Flight Distance

• Departure Delay

• Arrival Delay

## 🛠 Technologies Used

• Python

• Pandas & NumPy

• Matplotlib & Seaborn

• Scikit-learn

• Streamlit

• GitHub

## 🔍 Methodology
## 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

• Removed missing values

• Selected relevant features

• Filtered extreme values

## 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

• Delay distribution analysis

• Airline-wise delay comparison

• Correlation analysis

## 3️⃣ K-Means Clustering

• Flights were segmented into:

• Low Delay Risk

• Medium Delay Risk

• High Delay Risk

• This helps identify operational risk zones.

## 4️⃣ Linear Regression Model

Arrival delay was predicted based on:

• Flight distance

• Departure delay

Model performance evaluated using R² Score.

## 💰 Financial Loss Estimation
Assumption:
₹100 per minute of delay.

Financial Loss Formula:
Financial Loss = Arrival Delay × Cost per Minute

This quantifies operational inefficiencies in monetary terms.

## 🌐 Deployment

An interactive Streamlit application allows users to:

• Input flight distance

• Input departure delay

• Predict arrival delay

• Estimate financial loss

## 📈 Key Findings

• Departure delay strongly impacts arrival delay.

• Certain airline routes fall into high-risk delay clusters.

• Operational inefficiencies directly translate into revenue loss.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

• Improve departure scheduling systems.

• Focus on high-delay clusters.

• Use predictive analytics for proactive planning.

• Monitor delay cost impact regularly.
